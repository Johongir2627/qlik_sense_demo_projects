This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital operations, focusing on patient demographics, visits, treatments, costs, and provider performance. The visits table acts as the central fact table, connected to supporting dimension tables such as patients, procedures, diagnoses, departments, insurance, providers, cities, and a DateTable for time-based analysis. Key insights include total patients, average length of stay, room charges, medication expenses, and patient satisfaction trends. Users can analyze department efficiency, insurance coverage, and nationality-based treatment patterns. This dashboard helps healthcare management make data-driven decisions, optimize resources, and improve patient outcomes across different medical services.
